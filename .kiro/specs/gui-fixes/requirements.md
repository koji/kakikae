# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical GUI issues in the markdown converter application that prevent proper user interaction. The application currently has two main problems: the drag and drop functionality is not working due to missing dependencies, and the background color appears black instead of the intended white/light theme. These issues significantly impact user experience and the application's usability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to drag and drop files into the application, so that I can quickly select files for conversion without using the file dialog.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the drag and drop area SHALL be visible and clearly marked
2. WHEN a user drags files over the drop area THEN the area SHALL provide visual feedback indicating it can accept files
3. WHEN a user drops files onto the drop area THEN the files SHALL be added to the selected files list
4. WHEN files are successfully dropped THEN the status bar SHALL update to show the number of selected files
5. IF the tkinterdnd2 dependency is missing THEN the application SHALL display an error message or gracefully degrade

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to display exactly as shown in the reference image with proper white background and visible drag & drop area, so that the interface matches the intended design.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the main window background SHALL be white as specified in the code
2. WHEN the application renders THEN the background SHALL not appear black regardless of system settings
3. WHEN the drag and drop area is displayed THEN it SHALL be clearly visible with the light gray (#e9ecef) background
4. WHEN all UI elements are rendered THEN they SHALL match the visual appearance shown in the reference image
5. IF there are platform-specific rendering issues THEN the application SHALL implement workarounds to ensure consistent appearance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all required dependencies to be properly documented and installable, so that the application can be set up correctly in any environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the application THEN all required dependencies SHALL be listed in requirements.txt
2. WHEN installing dependencies THEN the tkinterdnd2 package SHALL be included for drag and drop functionality
3. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL verify that all required dependencies are available
4. IF any dependencies are missing THEN the application SHALL provide clear error messages indicating what needs to be installed
